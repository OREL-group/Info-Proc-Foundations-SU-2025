Welcome to Procrastidoro!

Here's a little bit about the program and how to use it:

In this base version of the program there are two timers: Productivity Time and Leisure Time.
To start Productivity Time input "start timer 1" or "s1". Input "start timer 2" or "s2" to start Leisure Time.
The current time on both timer can be checked by pressing enter.
To stop the timers use "stop timer 1" or "x1" for productivity and "stop timer 2" or "x2" for leisure.
The program can be stopped by inputing "exit" or "Exit".

Have fun and happy procrastinating!
