What the project does and why itâ€™s useful

The files within are for a rudimentary text based adventure and was created for a final project, however it was not fully completed. An addition that I would like to eventually include is importing text data from an external dataset into the program to create world descriptions.

How users can get started

The files in this project folder hold the necessary materials to manipulate and run the project code in an IDE or on your local machine. To run the program, you can copy and run the .py code within any IDE that accepts Python version 3.13 or later. There is an included executable file that can be downloaded and run on your local machine. project_text_adventure.py was written within Pycharm, a python 3 IDE from JetBrains.
