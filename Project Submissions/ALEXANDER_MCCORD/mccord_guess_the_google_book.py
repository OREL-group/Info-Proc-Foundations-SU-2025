# section.


# # This section sets up the elements that will be used in the game. It creates
# an array and populates it with strings of titles pulled from the above input
# Google Books search. Then randomly picks one title from that list to be put
# into play, and creates the empty spaces to be displayed to the player.
# Finally, it creates the guesses_left countdown, which is tested to see if the
# player has reached the fail state and the game ends.

# incorrectly, the guesses_left counter is lowered by 1. The game ends when
# guesses_left reaches 0 (fail state), or the word is filled in (win state).
